prompt_text: |
  Execute the implementation planning workflow using the plan template to generate design artifacts.
  1.Add Module 3 to Docusaurus with three chapters covering Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2.
  2.Integrate the module into the sidebar following the defined chapter order.
response_text: |
  Successfully completed the implementation planning for the Isaac Robotic Brain module. Key deliverables include:
  - Implementation plan document with technical context and constitution check
  - Research document resolving all technical unknowns
  - Data model for the educational content and interactions
  - API contracts for simulation and learning management
  - Quickstart guide for developers
  - Updated agent context with new technology information
  - Complete feature specification
  The plan follows the Docusaurus structure with three chapters as specified (Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2), and all artifacts comply with the project constitution.
