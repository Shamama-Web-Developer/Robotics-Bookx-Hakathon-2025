prompt_text: |
  Execute the implementation planning workflow using the plan template to generate design artifacts.
  1.Add Module 2 structure in Docusaurus with three chapters focused on Gazebo, Unity, and sensor simulation.
  2.Ensure module navigation and content strictly follow the approved specification.
response_text: |
  Successfully completed the implementation planning for the digital twin robotics module. Key deliverables include:
  - Implementation plan document with technical context and constitution check
  - Research document resolving all technical unknowns
  - Data model for the educational content and interactions
  - API contracts for simulation and learning management
  - Quickstart guide for developers
  - Updated agent context with new technology information
  The plan follows the Docusaurus structure with three chapters as specified, and all artifacts comply with the project constitution.
