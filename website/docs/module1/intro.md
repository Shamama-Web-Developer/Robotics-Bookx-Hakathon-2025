# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module serves as the foundational layer for all subsequent modules, introducing ROS 2 as the nervous system of a humanoid robot.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn how ROS 2 enables communication, coordination, and control between AI agents and physical (or simulated) actuators. We'll cover the fundamental concepts that make ROS 2 essential for humanoid robotics applications.

## What You'll Learn

1. **ROS 2 as a Robotic Nervous System** - Understanding the conceptual role of middleware in robotics, ROS 2 architecture, and real-time communication concepts
2. **Communication Primitives** - Exploring nodes, topics, and services with focus on bridging Python AI agents to robot controllers using rclpy
3. **URDF for Humanoid Descriptions** - Modeling the humanoid body with URDF, including links, joints, and coordinate frames

By the end of this module, you will be able to explain, design, and implement a ROS 2-based control architecture for a humanoid robot, and understand how Python-based AI agents interface with robotic controllers.
