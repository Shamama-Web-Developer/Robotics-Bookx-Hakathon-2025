# Digital Twin Robotics Module

Welcome to the Digital Twin Robotics module, a comprehensive educational resource for understanding physics-based simulation for robotics. This interactive module covers three core areas of digital twin technology for humanoid robots:

1. [Physics-Based Robot Simulation](./physics-simulation.md)
2. [High-Fidelity Rendering and Visualization](./rendering-twins.md)
3. [Sensor Simulation for Physical AI](./sensor-simulation.md)

## Overview

Digital twin technology is revolutionizing robotics by creating virtual replicas of physical robots that mirror real-world physics, sensors, and interactions. This module provides hands-on experience with:

- Physics simulation environments using realistic gravity, collisions, and dynamics
- High-fidelity rendering for enhanced human-robot interaction visualization
- Sensor simulation with realistic noise models for LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will understand:

- How to model physics-based simulation for robotics applications
- How to simulate gravity, collisions, and dynamics in virtual environments
- How to use rendering engines for high-fidelity visualization and human-robot interaction
- How to simulate core robotic sensors with realistic noise characteristics
- How sensor data supports AI applications in robotics

## Interactive Components

This module features several interactive components that allow you to experiment with different parameters and observe their effects in real-time:

- **Physics Simulation**: Adjust gravity, friction, and collision parameters to see how they affect robot behavior
- **Rendering Visualization**: Modify lighting conditions, materials, and viewing angles to understand how they impact perception
- **Sensor Simulation**: Analyze data from LiDAR, cameras, and IMUs with realistic noise models
